## Background

Applying SQL to analyze historical credit card transactions and consumption patterns in order to identify possible fraudulent transactions.

In this project, I accomplished three main tasks:



## THE PROCESS


1). Data Modeling: Define a database model to store the credit card transactions data and create a new PostgreSQL database using your model.
I isolated the transactions of each cardholder
Counted the transactions that are less than $2.00 per cardholder
Answered the question of suspicion with the cardholders

2). Data Engineering: Create a database schema on PostgreSQL and populate your database from the CSV files provided.
Created a database schema called card_transaction on Postgresql
created tables with a schema
populated tables with the seed
queried data with the query
3). Data Analysis: Analyze the data to identify possible fraudulent transactions.
Analysed and plotted graphs to represent the data

1. ERD ---> ERD_FOLDER---> ERD.PNG
2. SCHEMA --> Starter_Code---> schema
3. Query ---> Starter_Code ---> query
4. Seed ----> Starter_Code ----> Data

5. Code ---> Starter_Code ----> Starter_Files----> visual_data_analysis
